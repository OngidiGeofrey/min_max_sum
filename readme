Write a function that given five positive integers, it will find the minimum and the maximum
values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. The function should
return the respective minimum and the maximum values as a single line of two space separated
long integers. (20 marks). (test_name=min_max_sum)

For example, given this array: [1,3,5,7,9]
The minimum sum will be 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
The maximum sum will be 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24
Therefore, the output will be 16 24
